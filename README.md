### Milestone 1: Local XCM Transfer

To test the completion of the 1st Milestone and view local XCM transfer, you can run via zombienet.

Check out the 1st-milestone-11-22-22 release of [sequester-parachain-template](https://github.com/SequesterChain/sequester-parachain-template), [pallets/donations](https://github.com/SequesterChain/pallets), and [sequester-rococo](https://github.com/SequesterChain/sequester-rococo) in the SequesterChain repo.

Then, [install Zombienet](https://substrate.stackexchange.com/questions/4692/how-do-i-spin-up-a-testnet-with-zombienet) and run your platform equivalent of:

```
./zombienet-macos spawn milestone_1_config.toml -p native
```
